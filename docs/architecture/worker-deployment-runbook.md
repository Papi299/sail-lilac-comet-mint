# Worker Deployment Runbook (Phase 8B contract)

Provider-neutral deployment contract for the standalone VideoFetch Worker.

This document describes the invariants a Phase-8B deployment **must** satisfy.
It deliberately names **no** hosting provider, region, account id, bucket name,
hostname or credential. The host/provider decision belongs to Phase 8B and is
made by the Product Owner, because it determines persistent-volume semantics,
TLS termination, external egress enforcement, network-namespace ownership and
R2 placement/jurisdiction.

**Status: nothing in this document has been provisioned or deployed.** Phase 8A
produced the artefact only — `Dockerfile.worker` plus the Worker runtime. No
bucket exists, no credential exists, no host exists, and no DNS or firewall has
been touched.

## 1. Topology

| Invariant | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Replica count | **Exactly 1.** Horizontal autoscaling is not supported. |
| Durable state | One persistent volume mounted at `WORKER_DATA_DIRECTORY`. |
| Volume sharing | The SQLite volume MUST NOT be mounted read/write by a second replica. |
| Ephemeral storage | Writable scratch at `TEMP_DIRECTORY`, discarded freely. |
| Ingress | A TLS endpoint reachable by Vercel. |

The single-worker invariant is architectural, not incidental: durable job state
is worker-local SQLite, and the cancellation/idempotency contracts assume one
writer. A second replica sharing the volume corrupts both.

### Filesystem roles

```
/var/lib/videofetch    persistent volume   SQLite database + WAL/SHM sidecars ONLY
/tmp/videofetch        ephemeral           media working files ONLY
```

These must never be merged. Media is never written to the durable volume, and
durable state is never placed under `/tmp` — a temp-backed database silently
loses every job on restart.

The image is compatible with:

- a **read-only root filesystem**, plus
- a **writable persistent state mount**, plus
- a **writable ephemeral `/tmp`**.

Size the state volume for job metadata only (kilobytes to low megabytes). Size
ephemeral storage for the largest concurrent media artefact, which is bounded by
`MAX_FILE_SIZE`.

## 2. Container privileges

| Invariant | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Runtime user | **Non-root.** The image runs as UID 1000 (`node`). |
| Privileged mode | **Never.** |
| Host network | **Never.** The Worker must have its own network namespace. |
| Capabilities | Drop all. Add none. |
| `CAP_NET_ADMIN` | **Never granted.** |
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` | **Never granted.** |
| Docker socket | **Never mounted.** |
| Host filesystem | No writable host bind mounts beyond the state volume. |
| setuid helpers | None. |

The Worker requires no elevated capability of any kind. If a deployment appears
to need one, the deployment is wrong — not the image.

---

## 3. Networking and egress

The safe-egress policy is an **external, host/platform-owned infrastructure
boundary**. It is deliberately *not* implemented inside the container.

| Invariant | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Deny policy | Host/platform-enforced deny for private, reserved, loopback, link-local and cloud metadata destinations. |
| Enforcement point | Connection time, outside the container's control. |
| Worker capability | The Worker **cannot** read, weaken, mutate or bypass the policy. |
| Firewall tooling in image | None. No `nftables`, `iptables`, `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, `sudo` or Docker CLI is installed. |
| TLS | Terminated by trusted infrastructure **before** traffic crosses the public internet. The Worker itself speaks plain HTTP. |
| Exposed surface | One port only. No second admin or debug port. |

The container image is intentionally incapable of owning the firewall. That
incapability is the point: an application-level compromise cannot rewrite the
network policy that contains it.

**Phase 9 performs the actual safe-egress acceptance suite from INSIDE the
deployed Worker boundary** — direct-address, redirect, DNS, rebinding,
descendant, firewall-mutation and public-success cases. A deployment is not
accepted until that suite passes in situ. Phase 8A provides no egress evidence
and claims none.

---

## 4. yt-dlp

`YTDLP_NETWORK_ISOLATED` **must be `false` (or unset) throughout Phases 8 and 9.**

This is enforced in code, not merely by convention: the Worker runtime
**refuses to start** if the variable parses truthy (`1`, `true`, `yes`, in any
case, with surrounding whitespace ignored). The lock exists so an operator typo
or environment drift cannot activate yt-dlp before the Phase-9 acceptance
evidence is approved.

The Worker image does not install yt-dlp or Python at all. Diagnostics reports
`ytdlp: false` honestly.

Phase 10 — and only Phase 10, after approved Phase-9 evidence — may relax this
startup lock and enable the flag.

---

## 5. Object storage (R2)

| Invariant | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bucket | Private, Standard class. Never public-read. |
| Worker identity | `PutObject`, `HeadObject`, `DeleteObject` only. |
| Worker identity must NOT have | `GetObject`, presigning, `ListObjects`, or bucket administration. |
| Vercel identity | Signed `GetObject` only — a **separate** credential. |
| Credential separation | The Worker never receives `R2_SIGNER_*`; Vercel never receives `R2_WRITER_*`. |
| Provider lifecycle | A TTL backstop, configured only during authorized provisioning. |

Set the provider lifecycle retention slightly **longer** than the application
expiration (`FILE_EXPIRATION_MINUTES`) so ordinary Worker cleanup attempts the
exact-key deletion first and the provider TTL only catches what the Worker
missed.

Expiration is enforced by `expiresAt` in durable metadata, independently of
whether cleanup succeeded. A failed object deletion never extends user
authorization.

---

## 6. Secrets

| Invariant | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Baked into image | **Never.** The image contains no secret in any layer, `ENV` or build argument. |
| Supplied via | The platform's runtime secret store / environment injection. |
| Build arguments | Never used for credentials. |
| Logging | The Worker never logs `process.env`, R2 credentials, the HMAC secret, or exception cause chains. A configuration failure names the offending **variable** only, never its value. |

Required at runtime:

```
WORKER_DATA_DIRECTORY          absolute, persistent, not under /tmp
WORKER_CONTROL_KEY_ID          shared with Vercel
WORKER_CONTROL_SECRET          shared with Vercel, >= 32 UTF-8 bytes
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_BUCKET
R2_WRITER_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_WRITER_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Optional:

```
WORKER_BIND_HOST               default 0.0.0.0
WORKER_PORT                    default 8080
R2_JURISDICTION                default | eu | us
R2_WRITER_SESSION_TOKEN        temporary credentials only
WORKER_CONTROL_PREVIOUS_KEY_ID \  both or neither; ids must differ
WORKER_CONTROL_PREVIOUS_SECRET /
```

Every malformed **required** value fails startup closed, before `listen()`.

### HMAC rotation procedure

1. Set `WORKER_CONTROL_PREVIOUS_*` on the Worker to the **current** pair.
2. Set `WORKER_CONTROL_*` on the Worker to the **new** pair. Restart.
   The Worker now accepts both identities.
3. Update Vercel's `WORKER_CONTROL_*` to the new pair.
4. Once no request signs with the old key, clear `WORKER_CONTROL_PREVIOUS_*`
   and restart.

---

## 7. Startup and shutdown behaviour

Startup is strictly ordered and fails closed. The Worker does **not** listen
until all of the following have succeeded:

```
validate configuration
  -> prepare/validate persistent directory
  -> open SQLite
  -> apply migrations
  -> conservative recovery
  -> construct writer/executor/queue/service
  -> listen
  -> wake queue
```

- An unsupported **future** schema version is a startup failure.
- A corrupt or missing expected V1 schema is a startup failure.
- An existing incompatible database is **never** silently recreated or discarded.

Recovery policy on restart (unchanged and authoritative):

| Prior state | After recovery |
| :--- | :--- |
| `queued` | stays `queued`, resumes after the startup queue wake |
| interrupted active | fails deterministically with a worker-restart classification |
| `ready` | unchanged |
| terminal | unchanged |

An operator restart is **never** converted into a user `cancelled` state.

On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` the Worker stops accepting new connections, stops the
maintenance timer, stops claiming further queued work, aborts in-flight media
(so no FFmpeg descendant survives the container), and closes SQLite last, all
within a bounded grace period.

Configure the platform's termination grace period to at least the Worker's
shutdown grace so a clean SIGTERM is not truncated by an immediate SIGKILL.

---

## 8. Health and maintenance

| Endpoint | Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GET /v1/healthz` | Unauthenticated liveness/readiness. Container healthcheck uses this. |
| `GET /v1/diagnostics` | **Authenticated.** Never use it to gate container health. |

The image ships a Node-based healthcheck against `/v1/healthz`; no `curl` is
installed for it.

Bounded maintenance runs on a modest interval (60s) and never overlaps: expired
replay reservations, expired idempotency records, and exact-key deletion of
expired ready objects followed by conditional removal of exactly that job's
metadata. A failure in one category never stops the others and never terminates
the HTTP runtime.

---

## 9. Rollback and failure model

| Situation | Behaviour |
| :--- | :--- |
| Worker unavailable | Vercel **fails closed** with `WORKER_UNAVAILABLE`. |
| Local fallback | **Never.** Production must never fall back to running media processing or yt-dlp inside the Vercel runtime. |
| Worker down at expiry | Vercel still refuses to sign new URLs; the provider TTL eventually removes the object. |
| Rolling back the Worker | Deploy the previous image against the **same** persistent volume. Schema V1 is unchanged, so no data migration is involved. |
| Rolling forward | Never point a new Worker at a volume written by a **newer** schema — startup will refuse, by design. |

Because the replica count is exactly 1, a deployment is a brief interruption,
not a zero-downtime rollout. Queued jobs survive it; interrupted active jobs are
failed deterministically and may be retried by the user.

- [ ] Private R2 bucket created; lifecycle TTL backstop configured.
- [ ] Worker writer credentials created, scoped to Put/Head/Delete only.
- [ ] Vercel signer credentials created separately, scoped to signed GET only.
- [ ] `WORKER_CONTROL_*` generated and configured on both runtimes.
- [ ] `YTDLP_NETWORK_ISOLATED` confirmed false/unset.
- [ ] Termination grace period >= Worker shutdown grace.
